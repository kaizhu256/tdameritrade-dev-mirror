<li><b>MISCELLANEOUS. </b>This Dev Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive understanding and agreement between the parties regarding its subject matter and supersedes all prior oral or written agreements or understandings between the parties as to the subject matter of this Dev Agreement. The failure of either party to insist upon a strict performance of or to seek remedy of any one of the terms of this Dev Agreement or to exercise any right, remedy, or election set forth herein or permitted by law shall not constitute nor be construed as a waiver or relinquishment for the future enforcement of such term, condition, right, remedy or election, but such items shall continue and remain in force and effect. In no event will we be liable for any of your responsibilities or obligations hereunder (or for your failure to fulfill such obligations) even if we are aware of such failure.
